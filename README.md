**What is proot-distro?**

proot-distro is a proot helper that can be used in Termux. You can install this without adding additional repositories.

**What is the purpose of this project?**

The purpose for this is to add older, possibly useful distros back in a form of custom sh files.

**How can you add the distros you want?**

Simply copy the files you downloaded to ``/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/etc/proot-distro`` and they will show up.

**How do they appear as in the list?**

They appear as the distro's version then the file name. The comment and installation status will be shown if you use ``proot-distro list --verbose``.
